The Monte Carlo Simulation

The Monte Carlo Simulation is a mathematical technique that allows quantitative
analysis for decision making. In simple terms, to find a possible solution, you
find the possible outcomes for a subset of the problem and that should give you
a fair idea what the possible outcome can be.

Blackjack

I do not think this game needs an explanation but if you don't know the game
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack covers the basics.

The simulation takes into account the varied values of Ace ( 1 or 11). It does
not split. It kind plays like an amateur who knows the basics and has an idea of
 the game.

The dealer holds at 17 or above. The player only holds at 20 or above (ie Blackjack)

If they get more than 21 they bust and lose!

It plays the game a 1000 times and gives the probability of the player winning,
losing and drawing the game.

They are usually around

Win: 0.413
Lose: 0.551
Draw: 0.036

in general.
Once again reinstating the fact that if you do not know how to gamble, DONT.
